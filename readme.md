# Mission 1 

## Marlborough Campaign
This project is a demonstration of understanding of HTML and CSS coding languages, as part of Mission 1 of Mission Ready HQ L4 Full Stack Developer Accelerator Programme. The website showcases the many benefits of living and working in the Marlborough region of New Zealand. It includes information about the local business community, lifestyle, and people who have chosen to call Marlborough home.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The layout is divided into a hero section, pitch section, and feature stories section. The hero section includes an image and text that highlights the main message of the website. The pitch section provides more detailed information about the benefits of living and working in Marlborough and includes links to relevant resources. The feature stories section includes three sections that highlight different aspects of life in Marlborough, including business, lifestyle, and people.

The following HTML elements are used in this project:
- `<head>` tag which includes the title and links to a stylesheet and script file
- `<body>` tag which contains the content of the website
- `<div>` tags which are used to create the layout and structure of the website
- `<h1>`, `<h3>`, and `<h6>` tags for headings
- `<p>` tags for paragraphs
- `<img>` tags for images
- `<a>` tags for links
- `'Class'` and `'ID'` attributes for styling specific elements
- Email contact form which is hidden by default, but can be activated by JavaScript

In terms of CSS, the following styles have been applied:
- Flexbox layout is used in the feature-stories section to display the content in a grid format
- Background colour of the `<body>` and `<div>` elements are stylised
- Font stylisation has been applied to various elements such as `h1`, `h3`, `h6`, and `p`
- Margins and padding have been applied to elements
- Width and height have been applied to specific elements such as `hero-image`, `feature-images`.
- The website is also designed to be responsive, with styles that adjust for different screen sizes.

The website also includes an email contact form, hidden by default, which can be activated by JavaScript. This allows visitors to the website to easily get in touch with the team behind the website.
